Siri Shortcut Using Seats.Aero API to Find Flight Award Availability

Seats.Aero is a search engine to find flight award availability across different airline partners (https://seats.aero/). I created a Siri Shortcut that uses the Seats.Aero API that allows the user to select an origin/destination airport and flight dates and will send an email to the user showing the flights with the lowest points needed to book with the booking links.
